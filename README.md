# Cave Of The Dead - Remastered

`Source code disclaimer: This was decompiled via a third party UndertaleModTool script and is NOT guaranteed to be fully functional. I'm currently working on a decompilation of this as well as all of my other GMS games which will remain private until complete`

`The game is currently being fully decompiled and is available in the dev branch`

An abandoned remaster and port to GMS1 of my very first game. Which was subsequently replaced by Cave Of The Dead Classic (aka. The latest release). This version is based on the original v1.0 release. Ported from Game Maker 8.1 to Game Maker Studio v1.4. My original idea was to fully rework this game with all new graphics and music while including the original untouched version. An addiional idea was to extend the game and make an entire sequel on top of the remaster. But this much like the actual sequel was abandoned
